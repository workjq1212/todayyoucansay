Kennedy touts unconventional therapies for measles linked to disciplined Texas doctor - CNN.com.

Dr. David H. Frieden, who is director of the CDC's National Immunizations Program, said vaccines that cause autism are not recommended and that he would have recommended the vaccine for his patients.

"There are no vaccines that will give you an immunity to measles. That's not our concern," he said. "We're not going to use the information that we have about measles to help you with your own health care. That's just not our concern."
