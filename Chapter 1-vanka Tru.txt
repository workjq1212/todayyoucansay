Ivanka Trump is done with politics and says she isnâ€™t coming back - CNN's Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) December 4, 2016

Trump's new speech comes just days after the White House announced that Flynn may receive a $100,000 settlement from the Russian government.

The settlement, which was announced on Thursday, includes a $6.5 million payment to former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and $7 million from former National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The settlement is part of a larger settlement from the Justice Department for Flynn's actions in the 2016 campaign, which the White House says is part of a broader effort to punish the Trump campaign for its treatment of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

"I'm not going to go into specifics about specific settlements," Flynn said on Wednesday when asked about the settlement. "I just want to say that there has been an effort from the White House to get Russia to pay for those actions."

Flynn was fired as national security adviser last month after the Trump administration's sanctions against Russia and the Obama administration's recent moves to undermine the Democratic National Committee. But Trump's transition team said on Wednesday that Flynn had been fired at a time when he was trying to get the Russia investigation under control, and that Flynn's resignation would have to be decided by the White House.
