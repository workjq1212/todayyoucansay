March Madness will pay womenâ€™s teams under a new structure approved by the NCAA - CNN, ESPN, ESPNU, and ESPNU - and will give women the same opportunity to play at the All-Star Game as men, and for free.

The NCAA proposed a new structure to pay for women's college basketball since 1998, and last month the league announced it would propose a new structure to pay for women's college basketball in 2017.

The NCAA announced the changes in an announcement on Feb. 11.

The changes mean that women will not be paid more money, including tuition and fees, from teams at the All-Star Game than men.

The changes also mean women will be able to have the opportunity to attend games at the All-Star Game, which was held in 2015, while men will be able to attend games.

The change will also make it harder for women to play at the All-Star game without a full team.

The change will also make it easier for women to play in the All-Star Game at the same time men are required to play in the All-Star game.

Women will have a lower percentage of the games played at the All-Star Game than men, with the exception of the NCAA's women's college basketball tournament.

Women can only play for two consecutive games at the All-Star Game -- and no other team.

Women's college basketball is considered a non-traditional sport, with women playing only three games a season, including the NBA Finals.
