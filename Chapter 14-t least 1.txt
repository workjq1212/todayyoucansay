Two of the dead were reportedly from the plane's pilot, who was ejected from the jet after the accident.

The plane went down about 30km (23 miles) from the airport, and a statement from the South Korean state-run news agency KCNA said an engine failure caused the crash.

South Korean President Park Geun-hye said the pilot had been given a two-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to a manslaughter charge.
