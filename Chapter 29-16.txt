Small plane crashes with 5 aboard in Pennsylvania - ABC News

A plane carrying an estimated 50,000 passengers crashed north of Pittsburgh Thursday morning, killing at least five people and injuring at least three others, officials said.

A military jet carrying two additional members of the Air National Guard's 7th Combat Squadron crashed near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the military said. No personnel were injured.

The crash occurred after the service's 2nd Tactical Wing was called to a crash site in northwestern Pennsylvania, the military said.

The military said the jet was "overland" from Pennsylvania to the Atlantic Ocean about 15 hours away from the crash site, and was carrying a crew of 7.

The pilot was not injured.

Pennsylvania's National Guard says it has "no knowledge of any military emergency" during the accident.

The incident appears to have been a "complex mishap" caused by a propeller failure, Navy spokesman Capt. Peter Zwirner said.

"The aircraft was flying at a constant speed of about 30 knots, and the pilot did not engage on the runway at the time of the landing," Zwirner said at a briefing.

Officials declined to say what prompted the plane to land.

The Navy confirmed the accident to NBC Pittsburgh, but said the pilot was not seriously hurt.

The military said it is investigating the cause of the crash. Its aircrew are being notified of the incident.
