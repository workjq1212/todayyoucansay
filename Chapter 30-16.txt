More than 150 whales stranded on remote Australian beach - BBC.com.au.

Hundreds of miles offshore of Perth, a group of humpback whales have been rescued after a massive humpback humpback whale stranded on the remote Pacific coast of Australia caught its first glimpse of life.

The giant animal, with a large head, was spotted in the waters off the state's west coast.

It was then spotted by a group of humpback whales who came to the rescue on Saturday.

The group of humpback whales were spotted near the remote area of Wadden Beach, and the pair began to scour the ocean for water.

"We just got a call from someone who said, 'Hey, we've got some really big whales in the water,'" said Jason Wood, a whale biologist with the Australian Department of Health and Welfare.

"It was like, 'Hey, this is just unbelievable.'"

The three-meter-long, white whale, a male, was found on the beach in Wadden Beach off the western coast of Perth.

"Hapback whales are a big problem in the Western Pacific," said Wood from the Australian Department of Health and Welfare. "They're known to be very active and can be aggressive.

"It's a really big problem in the Western Pacific with the large number of them."
