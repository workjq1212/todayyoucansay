Tulsa race massacre probe finds 1921 horror was 'coordinated, military-style attack' - ABC News

More than 600 were killed and more than 300 were wounded in a mass shooting at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, high school on Saturday, state police said.

Investigators said the shooter, who lived in a parking garage in a suburban Tulsa suburb, was planning to kill and injure about 100 students during the school day party.

An autopsy to determine the cause of death was scheduled for Monday but a preliminary report showed a brain hemorrhage was found in his head, police said.

The school shooting was one of several mass shootings against high schools in the United States last year that left at least 100 people dead and more than 300 injured.

The massacre at the University of Tulsa in Tulsa, Oklahoma, took place on school property, and a gunman opened fire on an unarmed student, killing a 14-year-old girl and wounding another 14.

No one was hurt in the rampage, and the shooter, who lives in the parking garage, was not identified and authorities had not confirmed a motive.

A woman named Lisa Ransom was killed when a gunman opened fire on her in an apartment in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday night. She was taken to an Oklahoma hospital and died at the scene.

Police said Monday they had found no signs of gunfire in the parking area of the school, but authorities had not confirmed a motive.
