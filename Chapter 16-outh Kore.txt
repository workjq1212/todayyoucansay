Yoon has been transferred to the United States, but has not yet been charged with being a terrorist.

He is a member of a political party that is seeking to return to the political arena.

He was arrested on May 26 when police said he was planning to enter a country, but was not detained until July 21.

The South Korean authorities detained him after he was arrested in September, the Yonhap news agency reported.

Yoon was arrested on May 26 because he was allegedly planning to enter a country, but had not been detained until July 21.

He said that while he was being detained, he was told by the police that he would be able to return to the United States.

"I will return to the United States, I will be arrested by the authorities, I will be able to go within the United States, I will be able to return to America," he said.

Yoon, who is a former member of a political party that is seeking to return to the political arena, was also detained on May 26 because he was concerned about the security situation in the country.

He said that he had been detained at least three times in the past and that he had been told he would be released on July 20.
