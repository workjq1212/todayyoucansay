Car slams into Christmas market in Germany, killing 2 and injuring dozens - The Washington Post

A car plowed through Christmas market in Germany in a truck and killed two people, leaving at least two in critical condition, the German interior ministry said.

The truck was found at the market at the end of a street near the country's main railway station, authorities said in a statement.

The truck was driven by a man who was allegedly from the Jewish community in the western city of Duesseldorf, officials said.

After the crash, the driver was taken to hospital where he was treated for injuries, the ministry said.

The city's Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that the truck was heading towards the country's capital Berlin.

The incident took place on Dec. 1, when the driver drove a car with a red and white "Merkel" sticker on it.

Merkel said at the time that it had been a "very difficult day for us" and that the truck had been "working well for a long time."
