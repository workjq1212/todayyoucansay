Russia: Ukraine's Crimea Crisis

The U.S. and Russia are both pushing for a more open and transparent Ukraine, and Ukraine is the most important of the two for now. The sanctions, which the White House says are "clearly designed to punish the Russian Federation for its actions," are likely to trigger a wider escalation of violence, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has warned that he is prepared to use the situation as a pretext for further military action against Russia.

Russia, which has been providing the Ukrainian government with weapons and ammunition for years, has been accused of using the crisis in Crimea to gain a foothold for its military.

President-elect Donald Trump gave his backing to the talks in a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday. After Trump's announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Obama spoke to reporters.

"We don't have a policy of sanctions, but we want to see more cooperation in the security of Ukraine and in this respect to work together to end this crisis and resolve the situation in Ukraine," Lavrov said.
