Cyclone Alfred leaves thousands in eastern Australia without power ahead of rare landfall - Axios reports

A cyclone has hit the eastern Australian region of Axios in a north north-northwest direction, the state's meteorological department said.

The cyclone was declared under state law as a Category 5 storm on Tuesday.

The storm was heading in a north-south direction, and is forecast to leave a trail of destruction across the state.

"I think it's a good indicator that there's some significant damage in the state," Meteorologist Mike Smith said.

"It's a very heavy storm with a strong wind, and the wind direction is likely to be north to south across the state."

Bridget McInnes, meteorologist for the National Weather Service, said she was still unsure how long the storm would remain in the region.

"I think it's probably going to be very strong over the next year, maybe a year or two," she said.

"It's not going to be anywhere near the coast, and we're not getting any major rainfall.

"If you're in a place with wind, that means it's going to be difficult to stay out there, so you might want to avoid it."

Australian meteorologist John Wilson, a meteorologist for the Australian National University, said he expected the storm to continue in the south-west, but would be cautious.

"I think it's going to stay in the south-west, and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes south," he said.

"The wind direction is probably going to be north to south across the state, so it's not going to be much of a surprise."
