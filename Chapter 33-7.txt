Where to buy RTX 5060 Ti GPU â€” live updates and stock checker - Tom's Guide

Microsoft today confirmed that it has reached an agreement with Nvidia to purchase the rights to the high-end Titan X graphics processing unit.

This is the first time that Microsoft has bought a graphics processing unit from Nvidia and has been working on a partnership with the company since December 2006.

When it was announced in July 2006, Nvidia was keen to continue its dominance in the high-end graphics market.

Although it had begun working on a partnership with Nvidia, it did not include the Titan X as a partner in its plans.

The fact that it had bought the rights to the Titan X made it a better partner for Nvidia, as it could see the company's high-end graphics products expand.

However, Nvidia's first major acquisition was in 2006 when it bought the rights to the Titan X from Nvidia for $1.2 billion.

Since then the company has had to put the final touches on its new graphics processing unit in the hands of AMD and Intel.

However, Microsoft is now the only one of the three major graphics processors to have completed a deal with Nvidia - the other two being the GeForce GTX 1080 and the GeForce GTX Titan X.

Microsoft has now officially announced that it has reached that point, with the purchase of the rights to the graphics processing unit.

In a blog post today, Microsoft said: "Since it was announced earlier this year that Microsoft has reached an agreement with Nvidia to purchase the rights to the Titan X's high-end graphics processing unit, we have received feedback from our partners that the sale of the rights to the graphics processing unit will allow us to build on their success and work to offer a more complete solution
