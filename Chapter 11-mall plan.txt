Presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte has launched a campaign against the violence in his country, telling the nation to "get the hell out!"

The President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, said he would seek to eliminate "the scourge" of violence by reducing the number of killings and the number of injuries caused by firearms.

"I will not tolerate anyone who destroys the lives of all people, and this is why I am calling for the government to put into force measures to prevent this," Duterte said at a rally in the southern state of Mindanao on March 9.

The Philippines is one of the few nations that has not implemented a ban on the sale of firearms.

The President of the Philippines added that the "only people who will not be able to get rid of the scourge of violence is those who are not willing to abide by the law... And when I say those who are willing to abide by the law, I mean the law that is the law of the jungle."
