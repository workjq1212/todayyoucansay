SALT LAKE CITY â€” The long-awaited National Weather Service storm watch map is finally online.

The map, made available through the National Weather Service's storm watch map service, is available now for all of the agencies to view. The map includes a variety of data points that provide useful information for government officials, meteorologists and others.

But the map is also showing where the wind and hurricane threat is. The map displays tornado threat information for every jurisdiction, including the state and federal governments in the United States.

The map takes into account the weather conditions that would likely be expected to create a tornado on the ground, such as wind gusts and tornado frequency, wind speed and direction, and the strength and direction of the winds.

The analysis also shows how the storm will affect the landscape in the future, such as how the storm will be distributed by wind direction.

"It's a useful tool, and I think it will help all agencies to work with each other and manage the storm. The map shows the path of a tornado, and it shows the number of people that are affected based on the number of people that are in the area," said Bill Condon, the National Weather Service's meteorologist.

The map was first posted on Dec. 7. The map has been updated twice since
