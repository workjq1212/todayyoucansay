Netanyahu backs Trump’s Gaza ‘take over’ as Israeli defense minister instructs military to draw up voluntary migration plan - CNN

As we've reported, the IDF chief was given permission to create an extra command post to accommodate the increased numbers of Palestinians fleeing the conflict in the West Bank and Gaza.

The move was made a day after the IDF launched Operation Protective Edge, which has been used to expel Hamas militants from Gaza.

But the IDF said it would do nothing to stop the expansion of its forces, and instead focus on the security of Israel's civilian population.

"We do not want to end the occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip," the IDF said of the new command post in the Shifa district.

The new command post was originally planned to be more than 600 meters long and 70 meters wide. It is already home to more than 300 Palestinian civilians, and is in a military installation close to the border with Israel, according to the IDF.

The new command post is expected to be built in coordination with the IDF's operations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli defense minister has said the new base will be built in the West Bank.

The new base is not the first time that Hamas has used the Gaza Strip to carry out attacks.

Last week, a group of Hamas operatives targeted security forces in Gaza, killing at least four Israeli soldiers.

In the latest attacks, the IDF has also opened a new base to house more than 3,000 Palestinians killed in the fighting.

More than 2,900 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli and Palestinian attacks since November 2015, and more than 1,200 Palestinian civilians have been killed by the conflict.
