Derek Carr, a former NFL quarterback and two-time Super Bowl MVP, is set to be the primary pick in the upcoming NFL draft.

The first pick in the 2017 NFL Draft is currently the second-rounder in the draft.

The Raiders, who have won three straight games in a row this season, are among the last team to draft in a year in which they've lost two straight.

"I'm going to be excited for the opportunity to be the first pick," Carr said. "It's like a dream come true."

Carr is the latest Oakland receiver to be an immediate favorite of the Raiders.

In four years as a starting wide receiver, he caught 31 passes for 1,923 yards and two touchdowns.
