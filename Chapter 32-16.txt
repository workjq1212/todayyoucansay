Your Android phone just got a major audio upgrade for free - Google and Samsung models included - ZDNet has seen the biggest upgrade in Google's Android line-up in four years. The Android 5.1.1 Jelly Bean update was only available through the Google Play store and not through the Play Store.

The change is meant to help Google Play users experience the new Google Play Music app, which will no longer be available on Android devices. It'll be activated on the Google Play Store from April 10.

The update was announced at a press conference on Thursday.

ZDNet said it has been working with the app developers to make the update available to all Android devices. The company has also been working on a new way of displaying "Play Store" music from the Play Store, which will be a new addition to Android. In addition, ZDNet will be continuing to work with the app developers so that they can bring the new Play Store music to the Android platform.

ZDNet also said that it has noticed a significant increase in downloads of music that uses the Play Store. "We're monitoring the Play Store for any changes that our customers might make," ZDNet's Chris Wieber said.

ZDNet's Android 5.1.1 Jelly Bean update will be available in November.
