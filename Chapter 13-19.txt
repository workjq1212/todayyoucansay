US imposes export controls on chips for AI to counter China - Financial Times, April 9, 2012

"We expect [China] to follow the path of the US and the EU and look after the needs of the region. They are looking to do so, not to see China as the biggest threat to European and American interests."

The U.S. is concerned that China is in the process of developing its own "new-found" nuclear capability.

"China's nuclear program has been for decades a huge problem in the region," said former U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman James Baker in an interview on Wednesday.

"The US has to be concerned about this and we do not want to take any chances. China has built a nuclear arsenal, we have to be concerned about this."

In a separate interview, Baker said that China has been "the most aggressive of the two major powers" in nuclear technology.

"We are concerned about the fact that China has developed nuclear weapons and they are doing so in a way that we are not sure about," he said.

"What we should be concerned about is that China is making nuclear weapons, we are concerned about that."
