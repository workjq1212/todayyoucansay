US and Iran to begin critical nuclear talks as Trump threatens war - CNN

Former ambassador to the UN, Hillary Clinton, says she will not support a deal with Iran, as Trump attacked her for wanting to avoid a war.

Clinton said she would not be in any way opposed to a deal, but would stand with the Palestinians on the "very difficult decision" to leave the area of the Middle East where they want to live.

She said there was "only so much we can do" to ensure peace in the Middle East.

"We need to stop the madness that has been taking place in Washington and not just go with the flow," Clinton told reporters at a news conference in New York City.

"I would not be in any way opposed to a deal. I would stand for it. I would stand with the Palestinians. And I would not be in any way opposed to peace. And I would be in no way opposed to a deal."
