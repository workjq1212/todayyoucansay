Notre Dame vs. Indiana score, takeaways: Irish prove too much for overmatched Hoosiers, notch first CFP win - CBS Sports Network

The Cardinal overcame Michigan State and Arizona State for their first Pac-12 championship in three years and a two-game winning streak, but the Cardinal still have to win another one - and they're just one victory away from the Big Ten title.

With the exception of a touchdown pass to Stanford's Ryan Kelly, the Cardinal have been outscored by just 11.5 points per game. On the other hand, they're outscored 35.5 points per game by Michigan State, 35.5 points per game by Arizona State, and 35.5 points per game by Indiana, thanks in large part to quarterback Jalen Hurts.

The game was a bit of a mess for Notre Dame, so the Irish didn't really play well on offense, but the defense allowed seven sacks in the second half.

They also had a defensive tackle that wasn't exactly good.

"All the guys are in there, and I think they're all in there," said quarterback Shane Vereen, who was held to just five tackles. "We've got to get them to play well, and we've got to get them to get the ball in the end zone."
