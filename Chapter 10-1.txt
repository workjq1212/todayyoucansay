Federal judge pauses President Trump's order restricting gender-affirming care for trans youth - The Associated Press

'The law was a mistake. It's a very bad law. It's a very bad law. That is just the reality of the situation,' the judge said.

'They had the discretion to do that, but they didn't have the authority to do it.

'And I will tell you, the only thing that's done is to take that law away.'

Trump had earlier called for 'extreme vetting' of immigrants and said he would do everything to stop 'radical Islamic terrorism.'

He said he was 'extremely concerned' about the security of the U.S. and called the order'very bad.'

'This is a very dangerous order.'

The judge on Friday said the president 'was wrong to order this kind of action.'

'He's not going to allow it to happen in the United States because he knows it's wrong,' the judge said. 'He's not going to allow it to happen in the United States because he knows it's wrong.'

He added: 'And the fact that he's going to order this kind of order, this kind of action, in the United States, that we're in, that the fact that he's going to do it in this country in the first place, that is a very bad order.'

The judge said the order'requires that those who are arrested or charged with a crime, and those who are held in detention, that they undergo a background check and undergo a mental health check, and that the government has to provide certain information on those individuals before they can be released.'

The judge was referring to a 2015 order by the Obama administration that restricted the right for transgender people to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity.

It also banned transgender people from having their personal names and faces changed in public places, including in public restrooms.

'This order will not do that. This order will not do that,' the judge said.
