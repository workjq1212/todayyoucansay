The number of migrants in the first six months of this year was still only 4,200 in the same period in 2016.

The UN's refugee agency estimates that 1.5 million people are currently in limbo in Syria - and the number will double by the end of the year.

In the period from February to July, around 1.2 million refugees, many fleeing war, have crossed the Mediterranean, and the UN estimates that at least 2.1 million have died in the conflict.

The UN said on Wednesday that it had warned that the situation there was "increasingly likely to become even more serious with the continuing loss of potential future refugees".

It also said that it was also concerned that there were more people fleeing war in Syria than at any time since the end of the cold war.

The UNHCR said it had taken in 4,000 refugees from Syria in 2015, and said that 1,000 people had been transferred to other camps in Italy since the crisis began.

The UNHCR said that more than 900,000 people had been displaced since the end of the conflict.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said that over 1,500 people had been killed in the conflict.

The SOHR said that from July to August, more than 70% of the camps in Syria's east-west had been "destroyed" or "reduced to rubble".

According to its latest figures released on Wednesday, the number of "humanitarian" migrants in the world has increased by 7,000 since the beginning of the year, to 3,000 in July this year.

The UK's Home Office said the UK was the world's top importer of migrants since it became a member of the European Union in 1997.
