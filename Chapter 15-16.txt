New Zealand: Treaty Principles Bill voted down after widespread outrage - BBC News, 12 June 2013

If you're looking for a more comprehensive, independent analysis of the treaty, check out The World at War.

"You'll find that the bill would have been much more complex and more contentious. It would have had to deal with the most fundamental aspect of international law and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea."

At issue is the notion of "rights" in international waters.

The clause in the treaty says that countries can only declare "national security or defence" claims in the waters of a "state" when the claimant's territorial claims are recognised.

The bill would have called for an inquiry into how the government has been able to justify such claims.

The Bill would have also made it more difficult to declare claims to "national security or defence" if those claims were not recognised.

The Bill also states that the Royal United Services University (RUSU) would have to seek an annual licence from the Foreign Office.

The Bill was introduced by the NZ First MP Tim Katter, who was recently accused of failing to attend his first event in New Zealand.

"It is a shame that the Royal United Services University was not invited to join in the debate on the bill.

"For a country of its size, like New Zealand, such a significant and well-known institution, we would be delighted to hear from the RUSU in terms of how they feel about this bill."
