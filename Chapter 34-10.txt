New research upends theory about why Mars is red, scientists say - CNN A lot has been said about Mars from space, but is the surface red? How do the scientists explain the red color?

The most fascinating theory to emerge so far is that Mars is red. It's a pretty cool idea that Mars is a pretty cool place.

The first thing you'll notice about Curiosity, which is basically a roving rover in the middle of nowhere, is its color.

That's because the rover is running around the red planet's red planet, red.

So, Mars is actually red, but it's not like it's a green planet. It's like it's like it's a blue planet.

Scientists first described Mars as being red when they mapped the surface of Earth about 2.5 million years ago.

Now, this is a pretty exciting discovery, but it's still not completely clear what this red planet is.

In fact, it's not clear what makes this planet red, or whether it's a planet of red or a planet of blue.

The best way to understand what makes a red planet habitable is to use it as a model of how the Martian atmosphere is changing.

And, you know, it's not like the atmosphere of Mars is very different from that of Earth.

So, you know, Mars is pretty hot. And, you know, you can see the atmosphere changing. And, you know, you can see the sun changing.

But, it's not like it's a planet of red. And, you know, it's a red planet.

So, you can see the color changes. You can see the blue.

And, you know, you can see the Martian atmosphere changing.

And, you know, you can see the Martian temperature change.

The red planet is a different planet.

But, it is not a planet of red.

So, you know, the red planet is a different planet from Earth.

The red planet is a different planet from other planets.

We know that Mars is a different planet from Earth.

So, Mars is a different planet from
