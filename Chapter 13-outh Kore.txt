South Koreaâ€™s Yoon defies second summons over martial law decree - Al Jazeera English

A court in Seoul on Thursday sentenced two former Korean leaders to five years in prison for allegedly defying a court order to take over a military base in South Korea.

The court, in a unanimous decision, said the two former leaders acted with "substantial influence" over a military base in the isolated nation's western Pyongan province.

Lee Dong-ho, who served as leader of the Communist Party's Politburo, and Yoon Tae-seok, former deputy head of the Politburo Committee of the ruling Workers' Party, were arrested in July 2014 on charges of defying the ruling Communist Party's decision to establish the military base.

Prosecutors had said they had evidence of Lee Dong-ho and Yoon, and accused the pair of plotting to overthrow the leadership.

The two former leaders, who have been charged with defying the ruling Communist Party's decision to establish the military base, refused to comment on their case.

The ruling Communist Party, which is considered by some to be a moderate party, has been criticized for not taking steps to curb human rights abuses after South Korea's military launched a campaign to crush dissent.

The South Korean government has condemned the alleged crimes and pledged to crack down on the North's use of force.

Prosecutors said Lee and Yoon had been arrested on political espionage charges while Yoon had been ordered to pay a $5,000 fine to the US Embassy in Seoul.
