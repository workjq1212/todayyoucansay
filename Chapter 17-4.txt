Microplastics Could Accumulate in Our Brains More Than in Kidneys And Livers - ScienceAlert

We are working on a study that could help explain why the kidneys and liver are so vulnerable to bacterial infections, said Dr. George L. O. Fossey, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago and a co-director of the Institute for Microbiology's School of Medicine.

"It's hard to believe that in the gut, you have bacteria that are very strong, and that bacteria can get into our cells and get into our blood," Fossey said. "For some time now, we've been finding that there's a link between the gut and the immune system."

Scientists have been trying to explain why the bacteria are in our stomachs, intestines and lymph nodes, and have been finding that some are more likely to enter the bloodstream.

The researchers' study, published in the March issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, studied the gut bacteria that live on the surface of the human body and their presence in the intestines.

The study, which is led by Fossey and his colleagues, found that the bacteria are found in more than 100% of cases of type I diabetes, and the researchers found that they were present on at least 16% of cases.

The researchers found that when the immune system was activated, the bacteria were present as present in all of the individuals who received the antibiotics. That is,
