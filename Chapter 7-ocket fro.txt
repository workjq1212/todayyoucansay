Rocket from Yemen injures 16 in Tel Aviv, while Gazans mourn 12 children killed by Israeli strikes - PBS NewsHour

On Thursday, Israel's military said it had killed three Hezbollah rebel fighters in the southern Gaza Strip, adding that it had also killed one Palestinian militant.

"We are trying to establish a plan for a response that will be effective as soon as possible," Israeli military spokesman Lieutenant-General Benny Gantz told AFP.

But the Gaza Strip's militant group is not the only group of militants that Israel has targeted, with dozens of civilians being killed by Israeli strikes.

Israel has also targeted a number of civilians in the Sinai Peninsula, where it has launched a series of air strikes that have killed hundreds of militants, including four from Hamas.

Israel has also killed several militants from the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is one of the most militant rebel groups in the region.

The militant group is particularly focused on the territory it controls, with its military wing known as the Ahrar al-Sham - a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood and a branch of Al Qaeda - the group's official branch.
